The Summarize News and Email file will not work without minor changes to the EmailDatabase.csv and email_config.py. These files were purposely modified to remove any personal information.

-Please add the name and email of the intended target to the EmailDatabase.csv
-Add the log in information for the sending email account, as well as a port to create the email server on

Please note there are several features within the appliation that are not ready. It is my intention to further their development in the future. This includes:
-Customized news source based on response from an end user
